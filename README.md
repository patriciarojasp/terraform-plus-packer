# Terraform + Packer Demo

This repo is a combination of the [Learn Terraform Provisioning](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/provision/packer) & the [Get Started with HCP Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/hcp-get-started) tutorials.

It contains Terraform configuration you can use to learn how to provision Terraform instances with Packer as well as manage iterations in channels.
